# Introduction
#### Elo Rating System
The Elo rating system is a famous method invented by Arpad Elo to rate chess players. However, this rating system can apply to any skill-based game, i.e League of Legends, Go. A player's rating is determined by the results of every game they play. After playing each game, the score a player was expected to receive is compared to the actual score received. The larger the difference between them, the greater the change in the playerâ€™s rating. The general form of the equation is **New Rating = Old Rating + K * (Actual Score - Expected Score)**.
The constant **K** affects the influence each game has on rating.
#### Counter Strike: Global Offensive
Counter Strike: Global Offensive, or CSGO, is a famous first-person shooter game with almost 10 million unique players each month. In the game, there are two factions, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists. The objective of the Terrorists is to either plant the bomb and have it explode or kill all the Counter-Terrorists.
In the competitive mode, there are two teams, each having five players. For fifteen rounds, one team are the Terrorists while the other team are the Counter-Terrorists. At halftime, or once fifteen rounds are played, the teams switch; the team that was Terrorists become Counter-Terrorists and vice versa. The victor is decided when a team wins sixteen rounds.
# Application
This project uses the Elo rating system to predict the outcome of CSGO pro player matches. The goal is to become a better predictor than crowd percentages on CSGOLounge, a match betting site.

The data used in this project is scraped from HLTV.org using the requests library from python. The database is at [HLTV Statistics Page](http://www.hltv.org/?pageid=188).

First, the data is formatted. Pro player in-game names are parsed from the original data file and placed into a separate text file. Matches are sorted by the date they were played.
	
Currently, the program only makes a prediction on a match when each player in it has played at least 30 matches beforehand. From this, there is a total of 1175 different pro players and 8435 match outcomes being predicted.
The basic implementation of the Elo rating system using **K**=0.1 predicts 5436 games correctly with a mean squared error 0.302432.

Additionally, `new_map.cpp` gives each player a different rating on all (8) maps.
